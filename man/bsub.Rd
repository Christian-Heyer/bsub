\arguments{
\item{code}{The code chunk, it should be embraced by \code{{}}.}

\item{name}{If name is not specified, an internal name calculated by \code{\link[digest:digest]{digest::digest()}} on the chunk is automatically assigned.}

\item{packages}{A character vector with package names that will be loaded before running the script. There is a special name \verb{_in_session_}
that loads all the packages loaded in current R session.}

\item{image}{A character vector of \code{.RData}/\code{.rda} files that will be loaded before running the script.
When \code{image} is set to \code{TRUE}, all variables in \code{\link{.GlobalEnv}} will be saved
into a temporary file and all attached packages will be recorded. The temporary files
will be removed after the job is finished.}

\item{variables}{A character vector of variable names that will be loaded before running the script. There is a special name \verb{_all_functions_}
that saves all functions defined in the global environment.}

\item{share}{A character vector of variables names for which the variables are shared between jobs. Note the temporary \code{.RData} files are not deleted
automatically.}

\item{working_dir}{The working directory.}

\item{hours}{Running time of the job.}

\item{memory}{Memory usage of the job. It is measured in GB.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores.}

\item{R_version}{R version.}

\item{temp_dir}{Path of temporary folder where the temporary R/bash scripts will be put.}

\item{output_dir}{Path of output folder where the output/flag files will be put.}

\item{dependency}{A vector of job IDs that current job depends on.}

\item{enforce}{If a flag file for the job is found, whether to enforce to rerun the job.}

\item{local}{Run job locally (not submitting to the LSF cluster)?}

\item{script}{In \code{bsub_chunk()}, it is the path of a script where code chunks will be extracted and sent to the cluster.
It is always used with \code{start} and \code{end} arguments. In \code{bsub_script()}, it is the path of the R script to submit.}

\item{start}{A numeric vector that contains line indices of the starting code chunk or a character vector
that contain regular expression to match the start of code chunks.}

\item{end}{Same setting as \code{start}.}

\item{save_var}{Whether save the last variable in the code chunk? Later the variable
can be retrieved by \code{\link[=retrieve_var]{retrieve_var()}}.}

\item{sh_head}{Commands that are written as head of the sh script.}

\item{ask}{Whether to promote.}

\item{argv}{A string of command-line arguments.}

\item{...}{Command-line arguments can also be specified as name-value pairs.}

\item{cmd}{A single-line command.}

\item{sh}{Path of the bash script.}

\item{env_var}{Environment variables. It should be a named vector. Note environment variables can also be directly set in \code{sh_head}.}
}
\value{
A job ID.
