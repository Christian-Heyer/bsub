-------------------------------------------------------------

For us, if we are outside of DKFZ network, we first connect to DKFZ network by VPN,
then we only need one ssh connection to reach the submission node. However, in
other institutes, if you are outside of it, you might first need to connect to your
institute's server via ssh (server A), then on server A, you connect to the
job submission server, again via ssh (server B), which results in two ssh
connections (let's assume you cannot use `bjobs` command on server A).

Of course, you cannot establish two nested ssh connections, but we can do some
tricks on server A to run a pseudo `bjobs` which actually runs the real
`bjobs` on server B. Maybe you have already guessed, we need to, on server A,
to run `bjobs` on server B via ssh without interactively entering the
password.

The following instructions tell you how to configure `bsub_opt` so that you
can use **bsub** package on your own computer outside your institute's network.

- on server A, generate an ssh key so that you can connect from server A to B
  without entering password interactively.

On server A, in the shell:

```
ssh-keygen
```

Select where you store the key file (let's assume it is called
`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

copy the key to the server B:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@serverB
```

Test whether you need to enter password if you go from server A to B:

```
ssh user@serverB
```

- If you don't need to enter the password, on your own computer, use the
  following configuration:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
config_foo =  function(user = NULL) {
	bsub_opt$login_node = "serverA"
	bsub_opt$submission_node = NULL  # so that you cannot submit jobs!
	
	if(!is.null(user)) bsub_opt$user = user

	# you need to find out the value of `LSF_ENVDIR` and `LSF_SERVERDIR` on the submission node
	ssh_envir = "source /etc/profile; export LSF_ENVDIR=your_LSF_ENVDIR; export LSF_SERVERDIR=your_LSF_SERVERDIR"

	# we create pseudo `bjobs`/`bparam`/`bkill` which actually call the real commands on server B
	bsub_opt$ssh_envir = c(
		"source /etc/profile",
		qq("alias bjobs=\"ssh -i your_ssh_key @{bsub_opt$user}@serverB '@{ssh_envir};bjobs'\""),
		qq("alias bparam=\"ssh -i your_ssh_key @{bsub_opt$user}@serverB '@{ssh_envir};bparam'\""),
		qq("alias bkill=\"ssh -i your_ssh_key @{bsub_opt$user}@serverB '@{ssh_envir};bkill'\"")
	)
	invisible(NULL)
}
config_foo("your-user-name")
```

Now you can query job status with **bsub** from command line (by
`bjobs()`/`brecent()`/...) or with the interactive job monitor (by `monitor()`).
